        <h3>About the {{ method }} Method</h3>
        
        {% if method == 'statistical' %}
        <p>The statistical method uses frequency analysis and gap statistics to create a weighted probability distribution. Numbers are selected based on their historical frequency and how "due" they are to appear.</p>
        {% elif method == 'hot' %}
        <p>The hot numbers method selects numbers from among the most frequently drawn numbers in the historical data. These are the numbers that have appeared most often in past draws.</p>
        {% elif method == 'due' %}
        <p>The due numbers method focuses on numbers that haven't appeared recently compared to their expected frequency. These are numbers that are statistically "overdue" to appear.</p>
        {% elif method == 'random' %}
        <p>The pure random method generates completely random numbers without using any historical patterns. This is similar to how actual lottery drawings work.</p>
        {% elif method == 'ml' %}
        <p>The machine learning method uses a Random Forest algorithm to detect complex patterns in historical draws, considering factors like frequency in different time windows, gaps between appearances, and time-based patterns.</p>
